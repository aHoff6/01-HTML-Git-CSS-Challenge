# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

When too many non-semantic HTML elements are used, the content becomes difficult for a developer to read. In this project I went through the HTML content and replaced the undiscriptive "div" elements, and replaced them with more discriptive semantic elements that better represent their role. This solves having to spend so much time trying to figure out what each individual div represents. doing this challenge helped me to have a better understanding of semantic elements and how the browser reads them.
